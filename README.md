(Hugs and kisses)
Baby
Sneaking around,
thinking about
how you could play me
Call her a friend while
you’ve been calling me crazy
Daily, push me far away so
How could you blame me
Uhhh
’Cause I’m tired of you
using me like a safety net
I’m not buying your excuses,
don’t even waste
your breath oh yeah
Funny you’re wanting me back
I’m moving on
Matter of fact
I’m through
That’s on you
Don’t need your
Hugs and kisses
Hugs and kisses
Won’t make a difference
’Cause you did me dirty
So malicious
Can’t make it better
With your
Hugs and kisses
Hugs and kisses
You must be trippin’
If you think
you got me I’m already gone
Hugs and kisses
Hugs and kisses
Faithful
You wouldn’t know
even if you were an angel
Holding me down,
telling me I should be grateful
Shameful
You’re not heaven sent,
go back where you came from
I’m done
’Cause I’m tired of you
using me like a safety net
I’m not buying your excuses,
don’t even waste
your breath oh yeah
Funny you’re wanting me back
I’m moving on
Matter of fact
I’m through
That’s on you
Don’t need your
Hugs and kisses
Hugs and kisses
Won’t make a difference
’Cause you did me dirty
So malicious
Can’t make it better
With your
Hugs and kisses
Hugs and kisses
You must be trippin’
If you think
you got me I’m already gone
Hugs and kisses
Hugs and kisses
Won’t you miss me
with that XOXO
Miss me with that XO
Baby you should let go
XOXO
Miss me with that XO
If you didn’t,
now you know ohhhh
Don’t need your
Hugs and kisses
Hugs and kisses
Won’t make a difference
’Cause you did me dirty
So malicious
Can’t make it better
With your
Hugs and kisses
Hugs and kisses
You must be trippin’
If you think you got me
I’m already gone
Hugs and kisses
Hugs and kisses
