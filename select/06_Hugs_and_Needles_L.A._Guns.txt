Sex, drugs, something's happening
Needles and hugs, stick me, hold me
Now you're on your way to a place
In outer space, where the stars are bright
And your mind will race

Hey man, something's going down

Death, love, nothing's happening
Push, shove, chain reaction
Now you're on your way to a place
In outer space where the stars are bright
And your mind will race

Hey man, something's going down around here
Don't try, just fly, you can be free, you'll see
Hey man

Something's going down
Nothing's going down
Something's going down
Nothing's going down

Hey man, nothing's going down around here
Hey man, growing hazy never too clear
Now I'm on my way, now we're on our way
Don't try, just fly, you can be free you'll see
Hey man

Something's going down
Nothing's going down
Something's going down
Nothing's going down
Something's going down
Nothing's going down
Around here
