Never did much to restore
My self-confidence
And you said i should have more

I was only kidding when i said
Blind date
Sitting in your car
You got angry and hit my arm

Dashboard hugs from drunk boys

Got angry and hit the dashboard
I didn't want to talk about it
You didn't want to hear about it

Stare at the road i'm honored
There on the road my solemn word
Stare at the road i'm honored
Stay in my blood too long
I'm there on the road and honored
Fear of the road my solemn word
It stayed in my blood your honor
Too long

Said you liked hugs from boys
But i never saw them
I never saw them
But i knew they were there
